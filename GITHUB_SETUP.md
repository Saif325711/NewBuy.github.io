# GitHub Setup Commands

After creating your repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME with your actual GitHub username and repository name
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Example:
If your GitHub username is `saifulislam` and you name your repo `newbuy-ecommerce`:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/saifulislam/newbuy-ecommerce.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
